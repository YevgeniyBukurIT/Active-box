# Active-box WEB 

Itâ€˜s a full-fledged project, which consists of design and layout

:arrow_right: After studying the parts of CSS and HTML, I decided to create a full-fledged project. Thus, the layout of the [ActiveBox](http://psd-html-css.ru/templates/activebox-besplatnyy-html-shablon) site was chosen. Zoom, indents, and fonts were chosen for [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). To work with the layout, I used Photoshop c6, and for typesetting WebStorm.

:arrow_right: Since this is my first project - it is designed exclusively for PC screens, laptops and has a permanent extension of 1910-1080px

:ballot_box_with_check: The default parameters in CSS: 

```html
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

body {
    margin: 0;

}

*,
*:before,
*:after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
:ok: Also [my project](https://yevgeniybukurit.github.io/Active-box) was deployed in github pages
